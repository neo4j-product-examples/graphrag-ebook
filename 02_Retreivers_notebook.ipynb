Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports\\nof goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the Company's operations and supply\\nchain and limit the Company's ability to offer and distribute its products and services to customers.\\nThe impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply to countries and regions\\nwhere the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain\\noperations. Restrictive measures can require the Company to take various actions, including\\nchanging suppliers, restructuring business relationships, and ceasing to offer third-party applications\\non its platforms. Changing the Company's operations in accordance with new or changed\\nrestrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the\\nCompany's operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the\\nCompany may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For\\nexample, tensions between governments, including the U.S. and China, have in the past led to\\ntariffs and other restrictions being imposed on the Company's business. If disputes and conflicts\\nfurther escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe\\nand restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company's business. Political uncertainty\\nsurrounding trade and other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer\\nconfidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company's business.\\nMany of the Company's operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the\\nCompany's suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and\\nother natural disasters.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\\nThe Company is exposed to economic risk from interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The\\nCompany uses various strategies to manage these risks; however, they may still impact the\\nCompany\\'s consolidated financial statements.\\nInterest Rate Risk\\nThe Company is primarily exposed to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates and their impact on the\\nCompany\\'s investment portfolio and term debt. Increases in interest rates will negatively affect the\\nfair value of the Company\\'s investment portfolio and increase the interest expense on the\\nCompany\\'s term debt. To protect against interest rate risk, the Company may use derivative\\ninstruments, offset interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities, or control duration of the investment\\nand term debt portfolios.\\nThe following table sets forth potential impacts on the Company\\'s investment portfolio and term\\ndebt, including the effects of any associated derivatives, that would result from a hypothetical\\nincrease in relevant interest rates as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022 (dollars in\\nmillions):\\nInterest Rate\\nSensitive Instrument\\nHypothetical Interest\\nRate Increase\\nPotential Impact\\n2023\\n2022\\nInvestment portfolio\\n100 basis points, all tenors\\nDecline in fair value\\n$\\n3,089 \\n$\\n4,022 \\nTerm debt\\n100 basis points, all tenors\\nIncrease in annual interest expense\\n$\\n194 \\n$\\n201 \\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\\nThe Company\\'s exposure to foreign exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being a net\\nreceiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in exchange rates, and in particular a\\nstrengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company\\'s net sales and gross margins as\\nexpressed in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the fair values of certain of\\nthe Company\\'s assets and liabilities. To protect against foreign exchange rate risk, the Company\\nmay use derivative instruments, offset exposures, or adjust local currency pricing of its products and\\nservices. However, the Company may choose to not hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a\\nvariety of reasons, including accounting considerations or prohibitive cost.\\nThe Company applied a value-at-risk (\"VAR\") model to its foreign currency derivative positions to\\nassess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model used a Monte Carlo\\nsimulation. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to\\nthe Company\\'s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. Based on\\nthe results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in\\nfair value of $669 million and $1.0 billion as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022,\\nrespectively. Changes in the Company\\'s underlying foreign currency exposures, which were\\nexcluded from the assessment, generally offset changes in the fair values of the Company\\'s foreign\\ncurrency derivatives.\\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 26\\nMetadata\\nCIK: 320193\\nCUSIP6: 37833\\nSource: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019323000106/0000320193-23-000106.txt'

Restrictive measures can require the Company to take various actions, including\\nchanging suppliers, restructuring business relationships, and ceasing to offer third-party applications\\non its platforms.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\\nThe Company is exposed to economic risk from interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The\\nCompany uses various strategies to manage these risks; however, they may still impact the\\nCompany\\'s consolidated financial statements.\\nInterest Rate Risk\\nThe Company is primarily exposed to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates and their impact on the\\nCompany\\'s investment portfolio and term debt. Increases in interest rates will negatively affect the\\nfair value of the Company\\'s investment portfolio and increase the interest expense on the\\nCompany\\'s term debt. To protect against interest rate risk, the Company may use derivative\\ninstruments, offset interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities, or control duration of the investment\\nand term debt portfolios.\\nThe following table sets forth potential impacts on the Company\\'s investment portfolio and term\\ndebt, including the effects of any associated derivatives, that would result from a hypothetical\\nincrease in relevant interest rates as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022 (dollars in\\nmillions):\\nInterest Rate\\nSensitive Instrument\\nHypothetical Interest\\nRate Increase\\nPotential Impact\\n2023\\n2022\\nInvestment portfolio\\n100 basis points, all tenors\\nDecline in fair value\\n$\\n3,089 \\n$\\n4,022 \\nTerm debt\\n100 basis points, all tenors\\nIncrease in annual interest expense\\n$\\n194 \\n$\\n201 \\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\\nThe Company\\'s exposure to foreign exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being a net\\nreceiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in exchange rates, and in particular a\\nstrengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company\\'s net sales and gross margins as\\nexpressed in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the fair values of certain of\\nthe Company\\'s assets and liabilities. To protect against foreign exchange rate risk, the Company\\nmay use derivative instruments, offset exposures, or adjust local currency pricing of its products and\\nservices. However, the Company may choose to not hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a\\nvariety of reasons, including accounting considerations or prohibitive cost.\\nThe Company applied a value-at-risk (\"VAR\") model to its foreign currency derivative positions to\\nassess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model used a Monte Carlo\\nsimulation. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to\\nthe Company\\'s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. Based on\\nthe results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in\\nfair value of $669 million and $1.0 billion as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022,\\nrespectively. Changes in the Company\\'s underlying foreign currency exposures, which were\\nexcluded from the assessment, generally offset changes in the fair values of the Company\\'s foreign\\ncurrency

The highly\\nsophisticated software we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their\\nintended operation. Our customers increasingly rely on us for critical business functions and multiple\\nworkloads. Many of our products and services are interdependent with one another. Each of these\\ncircumstances potentially magnifies the impact of quality or reliability issues. Any defects we do not\\ndetect and fix in pre-release testing could cause reduced sales and revenue, damage to our\\nreputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal\\nliability. Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our\\nexposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge.\\nThere are limited suppliers for certain device and datacenter components. Our competitors use\\nsome of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity\\navailable to us. If components are delayed or become unavailable, whether because of supplier\\ncapacity constraint, industry shortages, legal or regulatory changes that restrict supply sources, or\\nother reasons, we may not obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales or\\ninadequate datacenter capacity to support the delivery and continued development of our products\\nand services. Component shortages, excess or obsolete inventory, or price reductions resulting in\\ninventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue. Xbox consoles, Surface devices,\\ndatacenter servers, and other hardware are assembled in Asia and other geographies that may be\\nsubject to disruptions in the supply chain, resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and\\noperating margins.\\nLEGAL, REGULATORY, AND LITIGATION RISKS\\nGovernment litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design\\nand market our products.\\n Government agencies closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign competition laws. Governments\\nare actively enforcing competition laws and regulations, and this includes scrutiny in potentially large\\nmarkets such as the EU, the U.S., and China. Some jurisdictions also allow competitors or\\nconsumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. U.S. federal and state antitrust authorities\\nhave previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business.\\n30\\nPART I\\nItem 1A\\n \\nFor example, the European Commission (\"the Commission\") closely scrutinizes the design of\\nhigh-volume Microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these\\nproducts, such as file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available to other companies.\\nFlagship product releases such as Windows can receive significant scrutiny under EU or other\\ncompetition laws.\\n \\nOur portfolio of first-party devices continues to grow; at the same time our OEM partners offer a\\nlarge variety of devices for our platforms. As a result, increasingly we both cooperate and compete\\nwith our OEM partners, creating a risk that we fail to do so in compliance with competition rules.\\nRegulatory scrutiny in this area may increase.

The Company sells its products and resells third-party products\\nin most of its major markets directly to customers through its retail and online stores and its direct\\nsales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as\\nthird-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2023, the\\nCompany's net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 37% and\\n63%, respectively, of total net sales.\\nCompetition\\nThe markets for the Company's products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized\\nby aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent\\nintroduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards,\\ncontinual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of\\ntechnological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and\\nbusinesses. Many of the Company's competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive\\npricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company's products and infringing on its\\nintellectual property.\\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 2\\nThe Company's ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and\\ntimely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The\\nCompany designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware,\\noperating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive\\nfactors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security\\nfeatures), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design\\ninnovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution\\ncapability, service and support, and corporate reputation.\\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal\\ncomputers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial\\ncompetition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution\\nand other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings with large\\ncustomer bases. In addition, some of the Company's competitors have broader product lines,\\nlower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been\\nparticularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins.\\nCertain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or\\nno profit or even at a loss. The Company's services compete with business models that provide\\ncontent to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and\\napplications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company's\\nproduct features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated solutions\\nthat are more competitive than those they currently offer.\\nSupply of Components\\nAlthough most components essential to the Company's business are generally available from\\nmultiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The\\nCompany also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for\\nsmartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many\\ncomponents used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at\\ntimes subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing

    "## Why \"Apple\" Queries Can Fail in Vector-Cypher Retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "When you ask a question like \"What are the risks that Apple faces?\" using a vector-Cypher retriever, you may not get the structured or complete answer you expect. Here’s why:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How Vector-Cypher Works:**  \n",
    "  - The retrieval process first performs a semantic search over all text chunks in the graph.\n",
    "  - It retrieves the top-k chunks most similar to your query—regardless of which company (or entity) they are about.\n",
    "  - The Cypher query then starts from each chunk and traverses the graph for related information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The Problem with Entity-Centric Queries:**  \n",
    "  - If your query is about \"Apple,\" but there are no chunks whose text is semantically similar to your query and also specifically about Apple, the retriever may return:\n",
    "    - Chunks about other companies.\n",
    "    - Chunks that mention \"risk\" but not \"Apple.\"\n",
    "    - Generic or boilerplate risk factor text.\n",
    "  - The Cypher query can only traverse from the retrieved chunk—it cannot \"filter\" or \"redirect\" to Apple if the chunk isn’t already about Apple.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Limitation:**  \n",
    "  - **The chunk is the anchor.** If your query is about an entity (like Apple), but the chunk retrieval is not entity-aware, you may never reach the correct node or context in the graph.\n",
    "  - This is especially problematic for broad or entity-centric questions, where you want to aggregate or summarize information about a specific node (e.g., a company) rather than just retrieve semantically similar passages.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Conclusion:**  \n",
    "> Vector-Cypher retrieval is powerful for finding relevant context, but it is fundamentally limited by the chunk-centric approach. For entity-centric questions, you need either:\n",
    "> - Chunks that are explicitly about the entity, or\n",
    "> - A retrieval/query strategy that starts from the entity node itself, not from arbitrary text chunks."

    "\n",
    "**How this query works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Semantic Search:**  \n",
    "  The vector retriever finds the top-k text chunks most relevant to your query (\"What risks connect major tech companies?\").\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Graph Traversal:**  \n",
    "  For each retrieved chunk (`node`):\n",
    "  - Follows the `:FROM_DOCUMENT` and `:FILED` relationships to a company (`c1`).\n",
    "  - Finds all risk factors (`risk`) that `c1` faces.\n",
    "  - Finds other companies (`c2`) that also face the same risk factor.\n",
    "  - Ensures that `c1` and `c2` are different companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Returns:**  \n",
    "  - `source_company`: The company from the retrieved chunk.\n",
    "  - `related_companies`: Companies sharing at least one risk with the source company.\n",
    "  - `shared_risks`: The names of the risk factors connecting these companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why this is powerful:**  \n",
    "  - Leverages the chunk as the semantic anchor, but then uses graph logic to discover structured, multi-entity relationships.\n",
    "  - Surfaces both the context (from the chunk) and the broader network of shared risks—something that pure semantic or pure graph search alone would struggle to do as effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Summary:**  \n",
    "> This approach is ideal for exploratory questions about relationships in your graph, where you want to start from relevant context but end up with structured, comparative insights.\n"

    "This section demonstrates how to use the `Text2CypherRetriever` to automatically generate Cypher queries from natural language questions.\n",

    "**How it works:**\n",
    "- The retriever uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to translate your plain-English query into a Cypher query, based on your Neo4j schema.\n",

    "1. You provide a natural language question, such as:\n",
    "   > \"What are the company names of companies owned by BlackRock Inc.\"\n",
    "2. The retriever generates a corresponding Cypher query using the schema and the LLM.\n",
    "3. The generated Cypher is printed, allowing you to inspect or execute it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this is powerful:**\n",
    "- Removes the need to manually write Cypher for each question.\n",
    "- Makes graph querying accessible to non-technical users.\n",
